    <h1> Soy Sauce and Garlic Marinated Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/chicken.jpeg" alt="Easy to make delicious grilled chicken!">
    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p>This is a very simple chicken recipe that is very popular with my family. The marinade is really simple to make
        and it takes only around 15 minutes for the entire recipe to be done (not including marination time). I
        guarantee your family will love it!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
